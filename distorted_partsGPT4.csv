I recently lost my job and my girlfriend has been paying for everything. I’m worried that I’m going to lose her because I can’t contribute much to our relationship. What if she leaves me because of this? I don’t think I would be able to handle that.,Magnification

"When I look in the mirror all I see is an ugly, worthless person staring back at me - I never used to be like this, I used to be happy. I guess this has to mean that I'll never be happy again.",Magnification
"Sometimes, I have this feeling of heaviness in my heart that doesn't seem to go away. It feels like a big stone is crushing me, making it hard for me to breathe, let alone carry on with my daily life. My doctor says it's just anxiety but to me, it feels like something much larger and scarier.",Magnification
"I did something really stupid yesterday. I freaking deleted my entire external storage on my phone. I lost everything. Pictures, music, ringtones, important documents, all gone. Fortunately, it was all backed up on my PC except for my ringtones. That’s what I’m really pissed about. I had spent a lot of time making custom ringtones for specific apps and contacts so I would know what’s going on without looking at my phone. Now they’re gone. Is there any way to recover them? I mean, they’re all on my phone in my contact and app settings but they won’t play because they’re not on the stupid external storage. I’m so freaking pissed at myself for deleting them! I spent time and energy making them and back them up and then stupidly deleted them. I hate this.",Magnification
"Even when I feel intense emotional pain, I choose not to express it to my boyfriend because I’m scared of what he’ll do. I’m scared he’ll abandon me, or reject me, or that he will hurt me. ",Magnification
"I'm not usually a big crier but ever since I found out about my husband's death I cry all the time. I cry when I see his face in a photo, I cry when I hear his voice on an old voicemail, I cry when I come across something he wrote or drew. I can't stop crying and I feel like I'm holding my breath between each sob. I don't know how long I can keep going. I don't know if I'll ever stop crying. I just can't imagine a future without him.",Magnification
"It’s just that sometimes I feel like my anxiety gets really intensified, and it gets to the point where my heart is beating hard and fast and I feel like I can’t breathe and I’m going to die.

"Ever since I was sexually assaulted I tend to not trust people as much as I used to. Over the past month, I have generalized this expectation to all men. I am unable to interact or even be by myself with any man including my very own brother and father. I have a part-time job in a retail store and I am unable to be at peace at my job as there are men everywhere. They don’t do anything to me but just their presence seems threatening. ",Magnification
No I don’t want to kill them; I just want to hurt them for the pain I’m in but I know how wrong that is and it’s eating me up inside because I’m not that kind of person and never wanted to be. I don’t want to be a monster. I almost cry when kids are mean to me.,Magnification

"I’m doing fine in school and a lot of people like me, but sometimes I just get these moments where I stop thinking rationally and just act on my emotions. People always tell me to just calm down and relax but I can’t! No one understands how I feel and I hate it, everyone just thinks I’m acting childish or something.",Magnification
"I feel like everyone constantly looks at me, notices my flaws and thinks I’m ugly, I’m fat, or I’m worthless. It’s constant and especially worse when I’m out in public. Just walking across the street makes me shrivel up inside because every car that passes, I think the drivers and passengers are looking at me and laughing or just making fun of me.",Magnification

"I thought I could go to work, but then every person I saw and every word they said to me reminds me of how lackluster my life is.

I feel like all my shortcomings, failures, and disappointments are magnified to an impossible size.",Magnification
I have been facing this problem for quite some time now where I feel like everyone around me is talking about me. They don’t say it to my face but I know it.

"When someone doesn't reply to my message quickly, I freak out and start assuming the worst, like maybe they're deliberately ignoring me, or they're mad at me, or they don't care about me anymore. It's hard to get out of this negative thought spiral once I get into it.",Magnification

Everything bad that happened in my life is my fault and the good things are just coincidences or luck.,Magnification

"The slightest hurt to me I can’t take it. I’m not doing it anymore. Everybody hates me and when I tell them to just forget about me, they say “that’s ridiculous” but nobody’s here when I’m alone. The times when I have called I got an attitude so I’m not doing it anymore.",Magnification

"I’m forced to not let anyone get close to me, as my personal details would be common gossip around school in a matter of days, regardless of whether they were my friend or not.",Magnification

I am being ignored by a friend and it feels like I am so stupid and boring.,Labeling

I failed a test so I am certain that I'm a complete idiot and destined to fail in life.,Labeling
"I can't shake off that I'm a complete failure in my life, no matter how many times my friends and family tell me otherwise.",Labeling
"I lost a brother 2 years ago. He was in a car accident with a friend, life flighted to a hospital and was pronounced brain dead eight hours later. He was an organ donor, so they kept him on life support for a few days longer. My siblings and I stayed with him until it was time for him to go. I just sat in the waiting room of the ICU for about a week straight. I saw it as a situation where he was already dead but, we were just watching his body die. I didn’t really have any emotion. I never cried, I hardly said anything. I was just there. Now it has gotten to the point where it’s almost as if the only thing I am capable of doing is completely removing myself from reality in order to avoid feelings.",Labeling
I'm pretty certain everyone around me believes I'm a failure. I'm just a never-ending disappointment.,Labeling
"My thoughts create everything, but my perspective creates my thoughts. In that way, I am godless and forever bound to merely existing.",Labeling

They have never been supportive or understanding of me, and it is obviously getting worse. Every day I am reminded of how I'm not good enough, and how I never will be. I am beyond ready to leave yet I am afraid the world will treat me the same.",Labeling
"As soon as I meet someone, my mind starts thinking all I do is mess up. Once I believe I’ve done something wrong, I immediately label myself as a total failure.",Labeling
I talked to my friends about it and they told me that needing help doesn't mean I'm weak but I feel like it does. I always like to be independent and do things by myself without needing help from others.,Labeling
"My first response was no, but then I thought ‘why not?’ especially because lately I have felt so depressed, irritable, anxious etc. and because I need for my well-being to change somehow.",Labeling
I'm an utter failure because I didn't land that job. They must think I'm incapable.,Labeling

"I always mess things up. I can't discuss tough issues with anyone patiently, I tend to rush into things and want answers even though I understand it won't help me but I can't stop myself. I feel terrible about it.",Labeling
"It’s hard for me to be nervous about anything, ever. Sitting down to first dates, job interviews, and parties seems like a breeze. And not because I’m always confident or never second-guess myself, but because I’m never really there. I’m a fraud, and that’s all there is to it.",Labeling
"I think I’m getting worse. I’m scared, feel hopeless, lethargic, fatigued, paranoid, my thoughts are racing, my heart is racing, my chest is tight, the disassociated feelings get worse each day, I’m starting to not recognize myself anymore.",Labeling
I feel I have always been second best. Even when we were first going out he would ditch me for his friends. I love him so much it hurts. I put him before everything else and it just seems like he could care less.,Labeling
"I went back to that same line of thinking that I’ve used on myself way too often which is “You're such a failure, you can't even follow a simple diet. How are you going to achieve your long term goals when you can't achieve something so simple!”",Labeling
"I’m such a stupid, useless, worthless person. I’m not as intelligent as everybody else. I can’t do anything right. I always ruin everything. My opinions and ideas aren’t worth anything. I shouldn’t bother sharing them with others. They don’t want to hear anything I have to say anyway.",Labeling

I have labeled myself as unlovable and I fear that everyone else sees me the same way.,Labeling
"Everyone thinks I am a slut. All my friends all have boyfriends and I don't because I’m not appealing.  I’m a bitter, angry person and everyone sees that. I have been rejected by all the men I sought after and all I am is worthless.",Labeling

"I have so much potential that I am not using, and it makes me feel like a lazy and worthless person.",Labeling
"I have always felt isolated and out of place, I've never had many friends and I can't maintain a relationship for more than a few weeks. I’m just not fit to be around other people, I'm not likable enough.",Labeling
My mom and dad divorced when I was 13. I lived with my mom but she brought lots of men in and out of her life and her bed. She would lock me in the basement with a bottle of rum and tell me not to come up till morning.,Labeling

I'm just a mess and no one will ever love someone like me. I'm too broken and too complicated.,Labeling
"Her voice is hoarse, she is frail and exhausted and finally she can no longer conceal her feelings. I can’t avoid her, she says. I have to face her directly. She is so annoying to me in every way.",Labeling
"I hate myself for being too much of a coward to make a choice. Either way, the consequences are mine alone. But I constantly worry about whether the decision I make is going to affect someone else negatively and then I’ll be the one to blame. Even though I know it’s a Catch-22 and it doesn’t really matter which scenario I choose, the fear of what ‘might’ happen stops me from deciding.",Labeling
"As a teenager, I've always had to struggle with my weight. Because of this, I've developed this awful habit of instantly labeling myself as 'ugly' whenever I see myself in the mirror. It's like, as long as I'm not as thin as my friends, I'm not pretty enough.",Labeling
"Sometimes I get the sense that people see me as boring or unapproachable. I’m very introspective and introverted. It’s a bit intense and perhaps overbearing, but it doesn’t mean that anyone thinks I am burdensome and I shouldn’t label myself that way.",Labeling
There’s no point in trying because I’m a loser and I will never achieve anything in life.,Labeling

"Even if I try my best, I always feel like a total failure.",Labeling
I'm afraid that I won't be good enough. I worry that my friends will find out that I'm boring and not want to hang out with me anymore. I feel like I have to constantly entertain them or else they'll get bored of me. I'm just not an interesting person.,Labeling
It’s too easy. I look at what I can do and compare it to others and I feel like I’m pathetic and can’t do anything that matters. I’m just completely inept and useless.,Labeling
"I don’t mean to be lazy, but things are just too hard to do sometimes.",Labeling

"I’m a senior and I feel like I'm stuck, I have missed many lectures and assignments, I feel doomed and can’t get my mind off ""what if"" scenarios.",Labeling
"I can't focus on anything because I always feel dumb and inadequate. My work fails to meet my expectations and I always let others down. Even if I give my best, results are always unsatisfactory, because I’m never going to be good enough.",Labeling
"Nobody loves me, nobody would miss me. I am invisible. I am useless. I am a drain on everybody. I am an idiot. I am a failure.",Labeling
"I feel like fleeing or escaping places. I'm always stressed at work and despite how much I try to persevere, my efforts go unnoticed and I feel no satisfaction in my tasks. Should I change my job and in that aspect, should I change my mind frame instead too?",Labeling
"When I get into a conversation, my mind just goes blank, and I can't think of anything to say. I believe it's because I'm a boring person with nothing interesting to contribute.",Labeling
"I can't do anything right. I'm a complete loser. There's no reason to even try anymore, because I'm only going to mess up again.",Labeling
"Every time I feel happiness, I get this intense fear that it will be taken away again. Because of my past, I now believe I am undeserving of joy, and when it does come, I ruin it for myself.",Labeling
"Of course, if I had the means, I would… if only for the sake of experiencing the feeling of having power over people's lives.",Labeling
"I always did well in subjects that I was interested in but I was also lazy and had a short attention span, so anything I was bored with, I didn't care about and didn't do well in because it just felt like a waste of time. It was bad of me not to try.",Labeling
"I am a procrastinator. Even though people keep telling me that I've been handling my work well, I can't help but think that I'm just lying to myself, marking time and waiting for things to go wrong.",Labeling
"Whenever something bad happens, I always think it's my fault. Even if it's clearly not related to me, I can't help but label myself as the cause of the problem.",Labeling

I m insecure because everybody made fun of me for acting different.,Labeling
"I am an insufferable nag. I’m constantly complaining about something: I’ve got too much work, I’m bored, I’m hungry, I’m not hungry. People avoid confrontations with me because they know I’ll make a big deal out of it.",Labeling

"I keep telling myself that I am no good, and I really struggle with it.",Labeling
"I’m just trying to get some answers so I can help myself.  I’m not going to try to go to a therapist because I feel like I’d be wasting their time, and they’d think I was a lunatic when I’m going through what I’m going through.",Labeling
I’m just a failure. I can’t do anything right. I’m useless and can’t contribute to society at all.,Labeling
"I've been struggling with self-worth for a while now - it's even harder when you're trapped inside your own head. Has anyone else felt like this? Scared of the thoughts that rattle inside your own mind? I think a lot of it comes from the notion that I'm not good enough, no matter what I achieve. Am I alone in this?",Labeling
"I am a loser. Anytime I have tried to apply for a job, to start a savings, I have lost. I couldn't even keep the savings for my nephews' toys. I lost them.",Labeling
"Having looked through my drawers I have an excessive amount of clothes I do not wear. Prolonged galavanting has left me with an excessive amount of clothes, so many that a large percentage is never worn and seems to hang in my wardrobe, on their coat hangars, like dishevelled beauty queens, eternally waiting to be worn in victory. I want to fix this.",Labeling

"After all the sh** I went through, because of my mistakes I started to label myself as the ‘bad person’ always blaming myself for every single thing that went wrong and even though it wasn’t my fault but I always felt like it’s mine. I was never okay, I was always tired and even scared but I kept on smiling thinking it would get better but it never did.",Labeling

"I constantly feel judged by others, so I tend to put extra effort into everything I do. I ended up exhausting myself because I assume people expect perfection from me.",Personalization
What’s great is that knowing all this has changed the way I look at the world. It has opened my eyes to all the stupidity we humans can conjure up in our heads and how we all need to challenge our fears even if it seems scary. I can live life much more intensely if I'm willing to constantly question why I believe the things I do. This has even inspired me to go to school and get my masters in counseling so I can help others who struggle like I do.,Personalization
I wrote down the things he said and showed my therapist.. she was alarmed and said he was harming me. I don’t understand why this is happening to me. What did I do wrong? I just feel so alone.,Personalization
"I feel like a burden all the time. Even when I'm just existing, not even speaking or doing anything, the fact that I'm taking up space makes me feel like a burden.

"Lately I’ve been fearing my own thoughts. Like a thought will pop in my head about something, then for the rest of the day I will be careful not to do anything that could relate back to that thought. Because what if I do something wrong unintentionally ? I feel like a terrible human being for even getting thoughts like that.",Personalization
"All my life, I've been the black sheep of the family. My siblings were always the golden children who could do no wrong, while everything I did was a huge problem. Today I'm still trying to prove to my family that I'm not the troubled child they made me out to be.",Personalization

"Every time I'm at school or work, I'm always worried. I look around, and I'm the only one who seems like they can't connect with anyone. I keep to myself most of the time, and it's hard for me to start a conversation. Even when I manage to talk to someone, I feel like they're thinking, ""Why is she so quiet? What's wrong with her?"" Most of the time, I worry about the worst case scenarios. I think about what I want to say, but then I hesitate and decide not to say it. I keep thinking that if I say something, they might laugh at me or think I'm stupid. It's really hard for me to be around people.",Personalization
I can't imagine any of my high school friends being sexually interested in me. I just don't understand the appeal. I feel like I would make for a good romantic partner but it doesn't seem to translate into real life.,Personalization
"I wanted to be in the top 10, but I missed it by a few points. I am such a failure in the academic world, and I'm wasting my time. I can't achieve anything because I am not intelligent enough. I am just an average student, and I don't have any special talent or skills.",Personalization

My friends do not invite me to hang out with them because they think I am boring and they would rather want to be around other people who make them laugh and have fun when I am just too serious and get easily stressed out over simple things.,Personalization
I always feel this deep shame and guilt over how I once came across this PTHC video when I was younger. I was terrified and wasn’t able to get the picture of my mind for days.,Personalization
The person I have been seeing for over a year now I have deep feelings for and he does for me but he keeps avoiding me and it hurts because I know he doesn’t want to hurt me and he just keeps apologizing saying it’s his fault.,Personalization
"I can’t help but replay that moment over and over again in my head. If I had done something differently, maybe we’d still be together. Now, I’m stuck in this constant state of self-doubt.",Personalization
"There are two people in this world that I truly hate: my boyfriend's ex and his best friend. His ex because she had him first, and his best friend because he does not like me and makes my boyfriend choose between the two of us.",Personalization
"I angrily storm out of the room after shouting at the two of them, my emotions getting the best of me. I’m fuming, pacing the balcony outside as ANOTHER party goes on without my presence. I keep on telling to myself ""its because of my speech"" or ""its because of my looks"" which is why I do not belong there. I want to laugh, drink, have a good time like normal people, but my brain keeps on pulling me in the opposite direction.",Personalization
I feel guilty when someone else takes up the responsibility of my emotions. It is not fair to burden them with my personal battles.,Personalization

"I always feel like my needs and wants don’t matter to anyone, including me, and so when someone chooses another day for our next date or says no to me, the disappointment and emptiness are overwhelming.",Personalization
I always have the feeling that my boss is always shaking his head when he sees me. He is probably very disappointed in me.,Personalization
It just hurts because I feel like I’m doing everything right and trying my best but I struggle every day at school so maybe it’s my fault.,Personalization
He doesn’t understand me even though we have been friends for a lifetime. I think it’s my fault as I’m not able to express myself well.,Personalization
I feel so tired and down these days and I hate myself because I am always the one causing everything.,Personalization
"Sherry is always angry with me and I have difficulty figuring out why; however based on the way she treats me compared to others, I assume it must be something I'm doing wrong.",Personalization
"Sometimes, even during prayer, I still condemn myself for my dark areas of sin & shortcoming. It must be me because God has promised peace to all believers and I'm not feeling it.",Personalization
"I feel so responsible for everything that's going wrong in my life. I constantly tell myself that I should have done things differently. I keep blaming myself, and it feels as if I'm the cause of everything bad that happens to me.",Personalization
Why did I do that? Was it something I said or did that upset her? Am I just a nuisance to her? Does she think that I'm not good enough for her?,Personalization
I feel stuck here. It feels like everyone except me is moving forward and getting on with their lives and here I am stuck in this same spot doing the same things everyday. I feel left behind.,Personalization

"I think because I'm not fun enough, my friends didn't invite me to the party.",Personalization

Why does everything go wrong? It’s my fault… Always my fault… No matter what it is.,Personalization
"My life has been a mess lately! My job is just getting worse, and my relationships aren’t getting any better. I wonder if it’s all my fault, if I’m just a failure…",Personalization
I feel like it’s all my fault that things are so messed up and I have tried to fix things so many times but I feel like unless she changes there is not much I can do.  I feel so much anger and pain inside and it affects me so much.,Personalization
"I’m 13 and although it seems ridiculous to many, I find myself obsessed with the idea that I am too big. I know that it mostly isn’t true but I compare myself to my peers and  I constantly believe that I am bigger than them. I am stuck in this mindset that I am bigger, or more fat, than everyone else, even if it clearly isn’t true.",Personalization
I'm so scared of other people's judgement on me that it has started to affect my social life. I can't get myself involved in any activities because I'm afraid that I'll be bad at them and that people will mock me. This fear has stopped me from enjoying life to the fullest.,Personalization
"I changed school, from a school I attended for eight years to this one, and still, I TRIED to make friends. But, LOL, I am invisible, mocking, ridiculing, you name it, and constantly talk about me behind my back and joke about me.",Personalization
My husband once again pointed out that I forgot to turn off the lights in our home. Maybe there is something seriously wrong with my memory. Maybe I am not equipped to even handle daily chores. I am such a failure.,Personalization

"Just as everyone warned me, I made a complete fool of myself at the party last night.",Personalization
"Most of the time, I feel like trash. Nothing I do matters. People probably still speak to me out of pity. No one would miss me if I was gone.",Personalization
I tell myself that it's my fault every time I get verbally abused by my friends. I think I deserve it because I must be making them upset somehow. I always end up thinking that I’m causing the issues.,Personalization

"Every time I interact with someone new I don’t know what to do with my body, my voice trembles, I say the wrong things, and I become extremely self-conscious.",Personalization
I've been unemployed for the past 3 months and I think my previous boss is badmouthing me to potential employers.,Personalization
"It’s as if being with her makes me go down this hole of depression. I feel like she doesn’t even care, she only bothers to be nice when she needs something.",Personalization
"This morning, I was so sure she was going to say something like that. I know she’s just trying to protect me, but it feels like she’s always waiting for me to fail. I feel like I’m constantly letting her down, and I don’t even know why. I just can’t seem to stop messing up.",Personalization
I've had a bad day today and it's all my fault. I should've done better but I just messed everything up.,Personalization

"Mom was so nice with everyone throughout our stay, she seemed happier than I had seen her in a long time and that bewildered me. I mean, why couldn’t she always be like that, especially for my sake?",Personalization
"My boyfriend cheated on me multiple times and every time I found out from the girls but he swears he was blackmailed into doing it. I eventually ended it with him and he got with his ex immediately after the first day; he actually cheated with her on me. He continued to manipulate me into seeing him pretending he cares about me and he wants to get back, he only wants sex. I confronted him so many times he just keeps blackmailing me saying things they have done with the other girls.",Personalization
"I also still to this day let myself get bitter over being born in New England. I was born too late in a time where New England is a complete shithole, and now I am a shitty millennial. This isn’t why I’m depressed, but it’s left me bitter.",Personalization
"It seems I’ve messed up everything I've tried in life, and now it scares me to try new things due to fear of failure.",Personalization
"I always seem to be the last one to know about changes, as if everyone assumes that I should just know about them without anyone even having to tell me.  ",Personalization
"I seem to go out of my way to make things physically comfortable for the people around me, even when that person is an abuser or someone who has hurt me in the past. I’m starting to realize that it’s because it gives me a sense of control over a situation and can be used as a preventative measure to avoid conflict or any situation where I might have to express my own needs and emotions.",Personalization
"Whenever my wife laughs while she’s on her phone, I immediately think she’s laughing at something I did or said. Is it always about me?",Personalization
"You think about how you could be so stupid for failure, and you convince yourself that it was because you were too naive.",Personalization
"She was shouting at me last time we met. She said that I am energetic, positive and active but sometimes I am very nervous when I meet new people. I don't have any friends and sometimes this anxiety destroys me from inside. I feel like something bad is going to happen.",Personalization
I blame myself when my colleagues struggle in work and any success from my co-workers feels like a failure on my part.,Personalization

"I keep thinking I chose this major because I genuinely liked it, but whenever I try to advance, I just keep failing. I can't shake off the feeling that I'm the real problem.",Personalization
"She went to my friends about our problems, which instigated me more. I ended up making a “scene” in front of everyone because I did not feel in control of the situation nor did I think it was fair what she was doing… I believe this destroyed her image of me and thus she left me.",Personalization

"Sometimes I feel if I'm not in constant control of situations or things around me, it'll all just fall apart.",Fortune-telling
I feel like everyone can read my mind. I have to be really careful about what I think because I feel like people can hear my thoughts.,Fortune-telling

"I feel alone and I know if I tried, to communicate all my feelings and worries to him, he would not understand my perspective at all. If I do something wrong by accident, I will imagine that he will hate me for it and abandon me, causing me to feel alone all over again.",Fortune-telling
I feel like I will always be alone because I can’t get along with anyone. I always think people are talking about me behind my back. I am scared to make new friends because what if they don't like me? I feel like there is no point in trying because it will just end in me being hurt.,Fortune-telling
"I have been worrying about my future lately. Mostly, I feel like I won’t be able to accomplish my goals in life and that I’ll be stuck in the same place forever.",Fortune-telling
"I know I'm going to fail this exam, despite studying all week. I just know the meeting tomorrow is going to be a disaster - it always is. I'm sure they won't like my presentation, they never do. I'm certain I won't get that promotion, they probably think I'm not competent enough.",Fortune-telling
"I've been having some pretty bad mood swings- my boyfriend likens it to a light-switch. Out of nowhere, I'll just start crying, or I'll get really angry over small things. I am extremely paranoid. I can't seem to trust people, for fear they'll just stab me in the back. I can't handle criticism, or rejection- It just brings me down so hard. I struggle with random triggers- Mentioning ex's, or any sexual content on TV/movies/music makes me extremely upset (I struggle with a lot of self-loathing, almost like I'm a prude). I blow things out of proportion- For instance, I worry excessively about the future, all I see in front of me is a black hole, I see no life beyond what's happening now.",Fortune-telling
"I don't feel like I have anyone in my life who really understands or takes my issues seriously. Until they become a danger to me, I'm forced to suffer in silence.",Fortune-telling

"Looking at this big lump of work, I can already tell that there's no way I'll be able to get it done on time.",Fortune-telling
The store owner was not satisfying my questions at all. He would tell me he had to go then he would keep talking to me in such a weird way. He might think of me as some businesswomen but because I kept refusing him he then showed some weird signs like he was ashamed of something. I do know that something odd must be going there but just not sure.,Fortune-telling
I have been in therapy for over a year now but I just can't see a future where I am free from depression.,Fortune-telling
"I get physically ill and feel like I’m always going to be ill. I feel like I’m never going to be normal, like I’m constantly going to be sick and no matter what I do, I’ll never get better.

I know that in reality I am a good person and the people who don't recognize that just aren't worth my time but I just can't get my emotions to match up. I feel like a failure as a loving and deserving person and I feel like I should just stop trying.,Fortune-telling
I'm fearful of certain higher up people at my job; I'm afraid they hate me or that I will lose my employment because of it.,Fortune-telling
My friends are going to abandon me eventually because I'm too weird.,Fortune-telling

"The relationship between “not failing” and anxiety makes me worry that if I don’t finish studying by the end of March, say, then I will fail the final. It feels impossible for me to lift myself out of this mental state and it’s causing me to lose productivity exponentially.",Fortune-telling
"I wonder if other people with BPD feel this way, but I constantly feel like everyone is out to get me. Like my friends don't really like me and are just pretending, or that my boyfriend doesn't really love me and it makes me act out in ways that I normally wouldn't.",Fortune-telling
I’m worried that if I don’t make it then I will waste everything and you won’t love me anymore. ,Fortune-telling
"I am always stuck in a cycle of worry. I worry about almost everything, and it gets in the way of living a normal life. I am constantly telling myself, 'This is it, I’m going to fail.' I worry that I won't make it out of my depression. It consumes my mind.",Fortune-telling

I want to be successful but I feel like I’m not good enough and I don’t have what it takes to get to where I want to be.,Fortune-telling

I just have a really low self-esteem. I feel like I’m just a burden to everyone around me.,Fortune-telling
I feel like my wife will eventually leave me because I am not good enough. This feeling is so strong and I can't help thinking about it.,Fortune-telling
"I never really know what I'm doing in life that would give me a sense of purpose or satisfaction. Even though I’m still somewhat young and have a good job and a roof over my head, I always feel this overwhelming sense of dread and melancholy.  Life seems pointless and I often wonder why I’m even here.",Fortune-telling

I feel it's useless for me to even try to apply for jobs because I've convinced myself that nobody would want to hire me. ,Fortune-telling
I strongly believe that something terrible is bound to happen since my life has been going too smoothly lately. ,Fortune-telling

I carry the weight of my friends on my shoulders and whenever they’re upset about anything it feels like my fault. This isn’t really about my friends, just relating to my mom. Anytime anything happens I feel like it’s my fault, just because that’s what I’ve always had to bear. Sometimes it’s event to the point where I’ll apologize for things before I’ve even done them.
