,"I don't understand why people say ""it takes two"" to make a relationship work. It doesn't take two; it takes one. One person needs to put forth effort into making sure both parties are happy and satisfied. If you want your partner to change or improve themselves, then you need to lead by example first. You cannot expect someone to change if you yourself aren't willing to change either.

It's important to understand that mental illnesses are not a choice; they are biological disorders that affect the brain. Just like any other disease, they require proper diagnosis and treatment.",No Distortion

,"The first thing you need to understand is that there isn't one single way to define or diagnose mental illnesses. Mental health professionals use various criteria and methods to determine whether someone has a particular condition. For example, if we look at the DSM-5, which is the most widely used diagnostic manual for mental disorders, it provides specific criteria for each diagnosis. However, even then, these criteria can vary depending on factors such as age, gender, culture, and severity of symptoms. So while your sister may not fit the exact definition of schizophrenia, it doesn't mean she doesn't have another type of mental illness. It's always best to consult with a professional who can assess her symptoms and provide an accurate diagnosis.",No Distortion
