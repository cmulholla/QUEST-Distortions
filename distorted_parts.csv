"I don't know why I still am here. I have a safe job but that's not what I want. I want to create things. Starting my own business, living by my own terms. But whenever I try to do it, I feel so embarrassed about my lack of abilities. That's why I'm stuck. In this job, in this life. Why should people care about what I do when there are others doing it better? Why should they listen to me when there are experts who know much more? Every time I create something, the imperfections stare me in the face. They are all I see, even when others tell me what Iâ€™ve created is good. I can't see their praises, just my errors.",All-or-nothing thinking
