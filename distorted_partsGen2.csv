"The reason why I don't talk about my feelings or express them is because if I did, people would judge me and think less of me. It's better to keep everything bottled up inside so no one knows how I truly feel.",Personalization
"The other night, I had dinner at my friend's house and she served us some delicious food. She told me she made everything herself, which impressed me even more.
